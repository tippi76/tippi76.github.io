I dream of walking into the wild,  
and go on alone till the far-off site  
I dream, I really do

Soaking the sunshine on a holy beach,  
Imaginations of the world to where the mind does reach

The pleasure of eyeing the naked night sky,  
wandering the world carefree  
On terms with mother nature, my magical spree

That big thought of a child when life was jolly  
that everything would remain the same level of holy

How come it changed to something so terrible  
How dare you treat me as so feeble

You call me a piece of flesh, a thing of desire  
but fail to see my inner fire

You say the shackles of fate have made me a girl  
so weak, so timid, bound to the base as the white of a pearl

To tell you the bitter truth I am no illustration  
I possess my madness, I live in another dimension

Clearing you out this is my biggest goal  
I do not have time for things with no Soul

Sure, I do not deny the possibility of occurrence of a parallel universe  
where you can confine me, bound me to do things on your norms and guidelines
